It's all new for me and I'm really excited to learn new stuff, especially about Git, because I haven't used it very often in my projects and all these things related to Git were always difficult for me and I wanted to understand what is going on here from the very beginning.

## 1. Linux CLI, and HTTP

1. Everything that was in this lesson was new for me
2. It was surprising for me that Linux OS is so powerful and simple to learn at the same time. At first commands may seem difficult and even irritating, but actually they're pretty simple
3. I do not use Linux in my daily life, but I'm sure I will use these commands I already learned in Git Bash terminal
